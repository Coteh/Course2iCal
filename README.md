# Course2iCal
Allows users to paste in their University of Guelph schedule and it will export it to iCal or allow them to export it to various calendar programs.

## Development Setup
You can simply open `index.html` on your browser to test out most functionality of Course2iCal.

If you would like to work on the logging functionality, you can run the following command to start a local PHP server on port 8000: (assuming `php` is installed on your system and in your PATH)

```
php -S localhost:8000
```
